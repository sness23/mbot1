minecraft bot
for bedrock minecraft

just try anything to get something to connect to my minecraft bedrock server

we just want a really simple bot to start with

if it could just autofish to start that would be great

that would be a good poc

because they just have to stand there

and when the screen changes
when the fish comes

then yank the rod back
then you caught the fish

bonus points to switch to a new rod

then auto dig in a straight line

then make a highway with obsidian

then mine all the diamon

then pvp 

then lots of utilities and a language

then really develop the language
hopefully it is just verse

ok write a language based on verse for it
like tinyverse
miniverse

first of all, just login

can we login

how about we

run a minecraft bedrock server
get claude to do that

then use one of the projects i found on github
or more of them if its helpful

and just login to the server

ideally you will then login to sness.net that would b
be super cool too, but i can login to this server
from another machine on my network and then
claude can be controlling the minecraft server as well

so i guess i first have to get those repos, i will put 
them in a directory called "repos"

ideally we write this in python or typescript

should run on ubuntu and other platforms less important

headless minecraft bedrock bot

oh yes, i will put the server in a directory called "bedrock"
